## üöÄ About This Project

This project is my personal corner of the web, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. It's built from scratch with a focus on a clean "neon-glass" aesthetic, smooth performance, and a great user experience.

The site is fully modular, using modern CSS for layout and ES6 JavaScript modules for clean, maintainable code.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Hamdan2045/Your-Repo-Name.git](https://github.com/Hamdan2045/Your-Repo-Name.git)
    cd Your-Repo-Name
    ```

2.  **Run with a Live Server:**
    Since the JavaScript uses ES6 Modules (`import`/`export`), you cannot run it by just opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
    * **Recommended:** Use the **"Live Server"** extension in VS Code.
    * Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
